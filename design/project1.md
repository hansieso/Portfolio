## Join Page

- Join Page
  - Initial join feature is simple, only asking for name, email, and password.
  - Wave uses the same color blend as the logo, front and center, prompting users to join.
  - Contact Us and About page are potential pages to be created in the future to provide extra detail to the UI.
