## ToDo: A Productivity Mobile App (Prototype)

### Challenge
Redesign a mobile app for improved user experience + student accountability on campus.

### Description
Our project aimed to tackle the challenge of enhancing student accountability on campus by redesigning a productivity mobile app. We aspired to provide students with a more efficient and user-friendly way to manage their tasks and responsibilities. The key objective was to create an app that not only improved student productivity but also made the user experience intuitive and visually appealing.

### Solution
ToDo is an application that allows students to create their own task list.

## Wireframing
The foundation of our redesign process involved meticulously crafting wireframes and user flows. These wireframes served as the architectural blueprint for the new app, outlining the layout, content placement, and user interactions. They played a pivotal role in guiding the visual transformation of the app.

## Icons
Specific icons were thoughtfully selected to represent the app's productivity theme. These icons, including Prod Icon 1 and Prod Icon 2, were strategically integrated to enhance the user experience and signify the productivity features of the app. Additionally, the choice of the "Man in suit" icon as a profile picture offered users a familiar and relatable image.

**Additional Detail and Iconography:** 
Our commitment to improving user productivity extended to providing users with tools to better manage their time. A clock icon was thoughtfully integrated into the task page, enabling users to gauge how much time they needed for specific tasks. This feature facilitated better planning and task management.
- Clock displayed to user in task page to help user indicate how much time they have to do set tasks â€” help plan out tasks to do.
- Font used: Poppins
