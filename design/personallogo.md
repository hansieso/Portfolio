## Personal Logo Design - Crafting an Identity Through Typography##

## Introduction:##
A Personal logo is a strong symbol of self-expression and creativity. This project revolves around creating a unique personal logo by using letters "H" and "S", my initials. 


## Research and Inspiration:##
Using Pinterest and the typography-rich archives of FontLibrary, I drew inspiration from different logos. This foundational stage involved sketching and brainstorming, exploring the possibilities of combining the letters "H" and "S." Throughout the research and sketching process, I found layered fonts to be the most appealing — in particular, 3D fonts. 


## Design using Figma##
Through Figma, I refined our designs and explored font types, sizes, and structures. By utilizing the "Roto" plugin, I achieved a three-dimensional effect, bringing depth and character to our logo, patterned with various dashes. I continued to experiment with font types, size, and structure. In particular, I tried to take parts of the letters H and S and used the flatten function, to take apart and piece together the letters.

Solid and Vectored (striped) H’s, presented in different angles.

3D H with smoothed out edges, vectored (striped) pink H used as background + the combination of the two designs.

## Final edits/applications##
After many tries with different colour combinations, I found that white, black (outline) and pink (F656E6) worked together the best and decided to implement these 3 colours together. I also wanted to include the vectored (stripped) design as shown above. and used the pink striped H as a second layer (background). 

If a reader is paying close attention, you may also spot that with some of the sketches/mock up designs, some of the front facing H’s in the 3D shapes are protruding out of the letter frame. To fix this issue, I used insert selection and layers of vectors to smoothen out the edges. 

## Final Result:##
