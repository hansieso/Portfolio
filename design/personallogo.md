H: A Personal Logo Design
Creating a personal Logo using typograph of letters of initials. (“H” and “S”)




Research + Sketching

Taking inspiration from various sources such as Pinterest and FontLibrary, I began sketching different designs of the letters “H” and “S”. 

Throughout the research and sketching process, I found layered fonts to be the most appealing — in particular, 3D fonts. 


Sketches.


Font types, size, and structure.

Figma 

I continued to experiment with font types, size, and structure. In particular, I tried to take parts of the letters H and S and used the flatten function, to take apart and piece together the letters.

Similarly, I implemented the designs that I sketched and researched into Figma. Using the plugin Roto and adding vectors of my own, I was able to make the letters three dimensional, and patterned with various dashes. 


Solid and Vectored (striped) H’s, presented in different angles.


3D H with smoothed out edges, vectored (striped) pink H used as background + the combination of the two designs. 

Final edits/applications

After many tries with different colour combinations, I found that white, black (outline) and pink (F656E6) worked together the best and decided to implement these 3 colours together. 

I also wanted to include the vectored (stripped) design as shown above. and used the pink striped H as a second layer (background). 

If a viewer is paying close attention, they may also spot that with some of the sketches/mock up designs, some of the front facing H’s in the 3D shapes are protruding out of the letter frame. To fix this issue, I used insert selection and layers of vectors to smoothen out the edges. 

Final Result:
